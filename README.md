Helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities. I will analyze the district-wide standardized test results and aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.


# PyCity Schools Analysis

- The data suggests an inverse correlation between per capita spending (spend per student by school) and overall passing rates.  Schools with lower overall passing rates often have higher per capita spending. 

    There is a significant disparity in overall passing rates between Charter and District schools. Charter schools boast a 90% passing rate, compared to District schools' 54%. This substantial difference may be attributed to variations in teaching methods, resources, and possibly student demographics.

    Additionally, addressing the gap in math and reading education could be an opportunity to enhance overall student performance with the consistently higher pass rate in reading compared to math across all schools.
